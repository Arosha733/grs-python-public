# Doing Web Requests in Python

You'll definitely want to check out my [web programming repository](https://github.com/gil-ryan/grs-web_programming-pub). I'll be developing a lot of informaiton  and tools in parallel to this repo. The reason for two is that Python is very powerful and commonly used to accomplish many of these tasks. However, it's such an advanced topic that my repository explores a lot more details of the protocol.

__Requests__ is the a nice Python library used for making web requests. It's a nice alternative to using Postman, but Postname will generate the code for you likely utilizing this library anyway.

```python
pip install requests
import request
```

Another way to utilize web request is with CURL.  CURL is a unix based command that can transfer data.
